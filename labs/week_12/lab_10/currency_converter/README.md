# Exercise: Flutter Currency Converter (USD â†” CAD)

## Objective:

### Create a Flutter application with two screens that allows users to convert between USD and CAD.

## Requirements:

### 1. Screen 1: Currency Input Screen

- Two text fields: one for USD and one for CAD.
- When the user enters a value in one field, the other should update automatically based on the exchange rate.
- A button to navigate to Screen 2.

### 2. Screen 2: Conversion Summary Screen

- Displays the converted values.
- Shows the exchange rate used.
- A button to return to Screen 1.

### 3. Additional Features:
- Use an API (e.g., ExchangeRate-API) or a static exchange rate (e.g., 1 USD = 1.35 CAD).
- Implement basic error handling (e.g., preventing empty inputs or non-numeric
values).
- Use TextEditingController to manage text input.
- Use Navigator for screen transitions.

### Hints for Implementation:
- Use TextFormField for user input.
- Use setState to update the converted values dynamically.
- Use MaterialPageRoute for navigation.
- Optionally, fetch the exchange rate from an API using http package.
